A (basic) Strat card is split into three possible columns, each containing 11 results of a 2d6 dice roll. Each column, therefore, has a triangular distribution of numbers from 2-12. There are six chances to roll a '7' for every '2' or '12'. Each result of this 2d6 outcome can also be divided by a d20 roll to create 20 "sub-chances" for each 2d6 "chance". Therefore, a player's Strat card can be divided into 2,160 possible outcomes. Each at-bat has a 50% chance to come from either the batter card or the pitcher card -- so each plate appearance has a total of 4,320 outcomes to work with. That's quite a bit of granularity. See the table below.


DICE ROLL   CHANCES     SUB-CHANCES
2           1 chance    20 sub-chances
3           2 chances   40 sub-chances
4           3 chances   60 sub-chances
5           4 chances   80 sub-chances
6           5 chances   100 sub-chances
7           6 chances   120 sub-chances
8           5 chances   100 sub-chances
9           4 chances   80 sub-chances
10          3 chances   60 sub-chances
11          2 chances   40 sub-chances
12          1 chance    20 sub-chances
TOTAL       36 chances  720 sub-chances

    x 3 columns = 2,160 sub-chances
    x 6 columns = 4,320 sub-chances


The goal is to accurately distribute the known statistical data for each player across these sub-chances. A player who hits more home runs would get more HOME RUN results on their card. However, pitchers can give up more or less home runs, so this must be accounted for on the pitcher's card as well and factored into the formula for calculating hits for the batter card. The home run formula for example:

HR = the batter's actual amount of MLB home runs for the season
AB = batter's total at-bats for the season
W = number of times they were walked
IW = number of times they were intentionally walked
HBP = number of times they were hit by a pitch

(4320 * HR) / (AB + (W - IW) + HBP) - 50

The dividend part of this formula (4320 * HR) proportions the total home runs across all possible sub-chances. The divisor part of the formula (AB + (W - IW) + HBP) is used in many of the calculations and is very close to actual plate appearances. The -50 from that total subtracts the average number of home runs given up by pitchers and must be removed from the batter's card. Other types of hits and outcomes are calculated similarly. A full list of formula (not all are used in the basic version for this application) can be found in Appendix A.

Some outcomes are split and use the d20, others never are. Walks are never split but extra base hits are. For this application, everything is converted to sub-chances to maintain a common unit of measurement. The results that never need sub-chances will divide evenly across chances.

These sub-chances need to be distributed in priority order. For a batter, this is roughly in order of best extra base hits through various outs. For a pitcher, it's walks, singles, and strikeouts first and then other outs. Here's a list of distribution priorities for a batter card. This application doesn't follow this exactly.

RESULT          SPLIT                               NOTES
homerun         1st half only   
triple          1st half unless after HR
double          1st half only unless after 3B/HR
single          never
walk            never                               begin at walk slot unless hits use it
hbp             never  
plus injury     never                               always on card
max lineout     never
strikeout       never                               use up Ks before other outs
flyball B       1st half only                       batter may get 1 flyball A 
groundball A    never
groundball B    never
lineout         1st half                            only result on single/out split, solid lineout is filler
popout/foulout  never                               filler

About the files:

player.js takes the MLB data as input from json files and transforms it into a list of sub-chances. It then constructs either a batter object or pitcher object that is used by card.js and app.js

card.js takes the calculated player object from player.js and distributes it appropriately across the 33 outcomes on a card. It takes a blank card data model and modifies it with results. That data card object is used by app.js

app.js takes the player object and data card object from player.js and card.js and constructs the view using pdfkit. This file is mostly for layout and design of the final card.

Appendix A: Formulas
