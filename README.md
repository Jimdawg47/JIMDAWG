**DISCLAIMER**: I am not affiliated with Strat-O-Matic Media, LLC. The cards and statistics generated by this application are not compatible with the official Strat-O-Matic game and are for academic purposes only.

**PROPOSITION**: Using the formulas found on [Bruce Bundy's site](http://www.cba-bb.net/Bundy.htm), and data from [Baseball Reference](http://www.baseball-reference.com/), try to create _plausible_ SOM cards.

**INSTRUCTIONS**: Download or clone this repository. Navigate to the directory and run

`npm install`

If there are no errors, run the app file, passing in a player's name as an argument. Note: The name must be spelled and capitalized exactly as it is in the json files or on [Baseball Reference](http://www.baseball-reference.com/). E.g.:

`node app "Kris Bryant"`

A pdf will be generated with that player's stats interpreted into _plausible_ results. The card will not be the same as the official card, but should have a relatively accurate distribution of at-bat outcomes.

If a pitcher's name is supplied, a pitcher's card will be generated. If you'd prefer to output the pitcher's batting card instead, just pass in the optional -b flag. E.g.:

`node app "Jake Arrieta" -b`

You can also generate an entire team at once. Pass in the team's capitalized three-letter abbreviation as found on Baseball Reference and it will create a directory with each player in it. E.g.:

`node app "CHC"`

If you'd like to generate cards for a different year, modify the CSV names in the config.js file. You'll need four CSV files from [Baseball Reference](http://www.baseball-reference.com/). Standard pitching, standard batting, standard fielding, and batting-pitching. e.g. https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2018-standard-fielding.shtml
