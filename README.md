**DISCLAIMER**: I am not affiliated with Strat-O-Matic Media, LLC. The cards and statistics generated by this application are not compatible with the official Strat-O-Matic game.
**PROPOSITION**: Using the formulae found on [Bruce Bundy's site](http://www.cba-bb.net/Bundy.htm), and a json file of 2016 MLB stats derived from an exported .csv on [Baseball Reference](http://www.baseball-reference.com/), try to create _plausible_ SOM cards.
**INSTRUCTIONS**: Download or clone this repository. Navigate to the directory and run

`npm install`

If there are no errors, run the app file, passing in a player's name as an argument. Note: The name must be spelled and capitalized exactly as it is in the json files. E.g.:

`node app "Kris Bryant"`

A pdf will be generated in the same directory with that player's stats interpreted into _plausible_ results. The card will not be the same as the official card, but should have a relatively accurate distribution of at-bat outcomes.
